# Course-Selector
Selenium course selector script to automate course registration.

## Project's motivation
Course registration in college can be daunting at first initial moments because lots of people try to get courses with limited capacity.
To get desired courses, you need to be fast and ready. Failed course registration can result as bad course schedule or selection of undesirable courses.
In order to eliminate the things mentioned above, I wrote Python Course Registration Script with Selenium browser automation packet.

## How to use
This script is only valid for my own college.
Any individual that wants to run script must;

1. Install Python, Firefox Browser and Selenium packet.
2. Enter her/his credentials to credentials.txt.
3. Modify coursenamelist and courseclasslist for desired courses.
4. Run script and enter captcha when it is asked for.

Script will try to register courses mentioned in coursenamelist and courseclasslist. Propably faster than any organic being.
